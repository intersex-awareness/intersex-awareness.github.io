<h1>Say "intersex"</h1>
<p>Intersex people are those born with bodies that are not well described by the binary model of sex. There is incredible physiological diversity among intersex bodies, but we are brought together as a community by our shared experiences. Intersex is the word we use to describe ourselves and our community. Clinical terms like DSD alone do not capture the social realities that intersex people face together, and they arenâ€™t widely used by the community. By adding the word intersex to your professional lexicon, you can help connect your intersex patients, clients, and students with the support they deserve.</p>
